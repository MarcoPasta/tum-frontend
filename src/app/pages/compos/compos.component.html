  <h1>General Rules</h1>

  <span>
    Remote-entries are allowed for all compos, but will not be handed a trophy.
    Only original work is allowed in our competitions, so you cannot use
    protected or unlicensed content. Any copyright violation charges will be
    passed on to the submitter of the production. All entries must be
    exclusively released for the first time at !TUM, and must be handed in
    before the deadline (as per timetable). By taking part in a competition, you
    are agreeing that weâ€™ll spread your contribution (e.g. through scene.org or
    other sites). Please submit a screenshot for your release, and .zip your
    entry before submission.

  <span>
    We reserve the right to disqualify entries, make changes or cancel
    competitions for any reason.
